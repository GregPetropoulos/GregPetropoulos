### Light 💡 up the Darkness! 


Thanks for stopping by and checking out my Git Hub profile.

My name is Greg Petropoulos and I am user focused Full Stack 🥞 Developer. 

Originally a geologist ⚒ and I love to dig in and discover 🔬 how things work and find the small ah-ha moments rewarding 🎉.

Have a great day!
